# Linux 102 - Debian

## Description
Debian is a Linux distribution that aims to be safe and reliable. A large number of Linux distributions use Debian as their base.

It forms the base for Ubuntu.

## Ubuntu
Ubuntu is arguably the most well known Debian based Linux distro available. There are also distros available that are based on Ubuntu.

Some well known Ubuntu based distros include: Xubuntu, Kubuntu and Mint.

## Virtual machines, containers and servers
Some distros focus on desktop usage, others are perfect to run virtualy, as a container or bare metal on a server. The virtualisation course uses Xubuntu. Docker uses Ubuntu and a distro called Alpine. Finaly, it's very easy to obtain or install an Ubuntu server.

## Raspberry Pi
On the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) computers, you will find a Debian distro called [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
